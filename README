GPU-Proxy is a "virtual" OpenGL ES 2.0 driver.  It exposes all GLES/EGL
to applications.  

Feature lists
1. Caching partial GL/EGL states such that GLES/EGL blocking calls
can return quickly.
2. To maximize both CPU and GPU execution, most APIs are non-blocking.
3. Non-blocking eglMakeCurrent() under certain conditions allows fast
context switch.
4. portable and works for all GLES 2.0 drivers

Build and installation
1. run "./autogen.sh --prefix=/installation_directly",
2. "make" and "make install"
3. for ARM platform, you can optimize by CFLAGS="-O2 -mfpu=neon"
